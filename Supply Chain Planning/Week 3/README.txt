2. There are five products for which you have to create a forecast. Start by creating an exponential smoothing forecast with the following initialization and alpha values:

                Product A    Product B    Product C    Product D    Product E
Initialization	96	         107	        164	         168	        217
Alpha         	0.1       	0.2         	0.3	         0.4	        0.5

In addition, you must apply the calculations for mean error, mean absolute percent error, 
and mean squared error for each of the five products (from the second period to the 30th period).

3. Save your answers and proceed to answer the quiz questions.
